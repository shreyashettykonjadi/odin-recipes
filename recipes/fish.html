    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mangalorean Fish Fry is a spicy and tangy seafood dish from the coastal region of Mangalore, India. Fresh fish is marinated in a flavorful blend of spices and then shallow-fried to perfection, resulting in a crispy exterior and succulent interior. This dish pairs excellently with steamed rice, neer dosa, or appam.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500 grams firm fish fillets (e.g., pomfret, kingfish, mackerel)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red chili powder (preferably Kashmiri for vibrant color)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tamarind extract or white vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice flour (optional, for added crispiness)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>A few curry leaves (optional, for added flavor)</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges and sliced onions for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Marinade:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, combine red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, black pepper powder, ginger-garlic paste, tamarind extract (or vinegar), and salt. Mix well to form a thick paste. If the mixture is too dry, add a few drops of water to achieve a spreadable consistency.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Marinate the Fish:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Clean and pat dry the fish fillets. Make shallow slits on both sides to allow the marinade to penetrate.</li>
                <li>Evenly coat the fish with the prepared spice paste, ensuring it gets into the slits. If using, sprinkle rice flour over the marinated fish for extra crispiness.</li>
                <li>Let the fish marinate for at least 30 minutes to absorb the flavors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Fry the Fish:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add curry leaves to the oil for added aroma (optional).</li>
                <li>Place the marinated fish fillets in the skillet. Fry each side for about 3-4 minutes or until the exterior is crispy and golden brown, and the fish is cooked through.</li>
                <li>Remove the fish from the skillet and place on paper towels to absorb excess oil.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Transfer the fried fish to a serving platter. Garnish with lemon wedges and sliced onions.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with steamed rice, neer dosa, or appam for a traditional Mangalorean meal.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
